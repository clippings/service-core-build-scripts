## coverage
### Overview
Enables code coverage collection with [JaCoCo](https://www.eclemma.org/jacoco/).
To open the coverage report in browser use: `open build/reports/jacoco/test/html/index.html`


### Configuration
* `coverage_excludes` configuration property controls which files will be excluded from coverage.
* `skipCoverage` configuration disables temporary the coverage report. Usage: `./gradlew clean build -PskipCoverage`


### Defaults
```groovy
ext {
  coverage_excludes = [
    'com/dt/**/dto/*', 'com/dt/**/api/*', // usually autogenerated code
    'com/dt/**/Constants*', // this is just a bunch of constants
    'com/dt/**/*Exception*', // exception coverage is overkill
  ]
}
```
